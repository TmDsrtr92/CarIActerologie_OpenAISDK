## Understanding Characterology

### Ren√© Le Senne's Framework

CarIActerology is based on the work of French philosopher Ren√© Le Senne (1882-1954), whose characterology system remains one of the most systematic approaches to personality classification.

#### The Three Core Factors

**1. Emotionality (E/nE)**
- **Emotional (E)**: You react strongly to experiences, feel deeply, and are easily moved by events
- **Non-Emotional (nE)**: You maintain calm, stable responses and are less affected by external circumstances

**2. Activity (A/nA)**  
- **Active (A)**: You have high initiative, tend to act quickly, and enjoy engaging with the world
- **Non-Active (nA)**: You prefer reflection, contemplation, and thoughtful consideration before acting

**3. Resonance (P/S)**
- **Primary (P)**: You focus on immediate, present experiences and react spontaneously
- **Secondary (S)**: You consider long-term consequences and reflect before responding

#### The Eight Character Types

| Type | Formula | Key Traits | Typical Behaviors |
|------|---------|------------|------------------|
| **Nervous** | EnAP | Sensitive, creative, impulsive | Quick emotional reactions, artistic tendencies, inconsistent follow-through |
| **Sanguine** | EAP | Optimistic, social, adaptable | Enthusiastic about new projects, enjoys social interaction, present-focused |
| **Choleric** | EAS | Passionate, driven, strategic | Strong leadership qualities, goal-oriented, can be impatient with others |
| **Melancholic** | EnAS | Thoughtful, deep, introspective | Rich inner life, loyalty to ideas and people, prone to worry |
| **Phlegmatic** | nEnAS | Calm, systematic, thorough | Methodical approach, steady progress, resistant to pressure |
| **Apathetic** | nEnAP | Adaptable, flexible, easy-going | Goes with the flow, avoids conflict, lives in the moment |
| **Amorphous** | nEAP | Practical, social, immediate | Focused on concrete tasks, enjoys variety, avoids long-term planning |
| **Passionate** | nEAS | Determined, methodical, intense | Single-minded focus, builds toward long-term goals, can be inflexible |
