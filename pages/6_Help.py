            **Historical Context:**
            Ren√© Le Senne (1882-1954) was a French philosopher and psychologist who developed a comprehensive 
            characterology system published in his "Treatise on Characterology" (1945). His framework 
            remains one of the most systematic approaches to personality classification.
            
            **The Three Primary Factors:**
            
            **1. Emotionality (E / nE)**
            - **Emotional (E):** Strong reactions to stimuli, deeply affected by experiences
            - **Non-Emotional (nE):** Calm, stable responses, less affected by external events
            
            **2. Activity (A / nA)**
            - **Active (A):** High initiative, tendency to act and engage
            - **Non-Active (nA):** Passive, contemplative, prefers reflection to action
            
            **3. Resonance (P / S)**
            - **Primary (P):** Immediate, present-focused, spontaneous responses
            - **Secondary (S):** Reflective, future-focused, considers long-term consequences
