# Branch Protection Rules Configuration

This document describes the recommended branch protection rules for the CarIActerology repository.

## üìã Manual Setup Required

### Steps to Configure:
1. Go to GitHub repository Settings
2. Navigate to "Branches" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Add rule" for each branch listed below
4. Apply the specified settings

## üîí Main Branch Protection Rules

### Branch: `main`

**Rule Name:** `main-branch-protection`

**Settings to Enable:**
- ‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - Require approvals: **1**
  - Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  - Require review from code owners (if CODEOWNERS file exists)

- ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - **Required status checks:**
    - `Code Quality & Testing / lint-and-test`
    - `Security Scanning / security-scan`
    - `Build Validation / build-and-validate`

- ‚úÖ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

- ‚úÖ **Require signed commits**

- ‚úÖ **Require linear history**

- ‚úÖ **Include administrators**

- ‚úÖ **Restrict pushes that create files**

- ‚ùå **Allow force pushes** (disabled)

- ‚ùå **Allow deletions** (disabled)

## üöÄ Develop Branch Protection Rules

### Branch: `develop`

**Rule Name:** `develop-branch-protection`

**Settings to Enable:**
- ‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - Require approvals: **1**
  - Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed

- ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - **Required status checks:**
    - `Code Quality & Testing / lint-and-test`
    - `Build Validation / build-and-validate`

- ‚úÖ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

- ‚úÖ **Include administrators**

- ‚ùå **Allow force pushes** (disabled for main contributors)

- ‚ùå **Allow deletions** (disabled)

---

## üåü Feature Branch Recommendations

### Branch Pattern: `feature/*`

**Recommended Workflow:**
- Create feature branches from `develop`
- No strict protection rules (to allow rapid development)
- Automatic deletion after merge
- Regular sync with `develop` branch

### Branch Pattern: `hotfix/*`

**Emergency Fixes:**
- Can branch from `main` for critical issues
- Must merge back to both `main` and `develop`
- Require immediate review and approval
- Document emergency procedures

---

## ü§ñ GitHub Actions Integration

### Required Status Checks Configuration

The following GitHub Actions workflows must complete successfully before merging:

**For `main` branch:**
```yaml
required_status_checks:
  - "Code Quality & Testing"
  - "Security Scanning" 
  - "Build Validation"
  - "Deploy to Production" (if deployment enabled)
```

**For `develop` branch:**
```yaml
required_status_checks:
  - "Code Quality & Testing"
  - "Build Validation"
  - "Deploy to Staging" (if deployment enabled)
```

### Bypass Permissions

**Emergency Bypass:** Only repository administrators can bypass these rules in genuine emergency situations.

**Required Documentation:** Any bypass must be documented with:
- Reason for bypass
- Risk assessment
- Follow-up remediation plan

## üë• Code Review Requirements

### Review Assignment Rules

**Main Branch PRs:**
- Minimum 1 approval required
- Review from code owner (if applicable)
- Cannot be approved by PR author
- Stale reviews dismissed on new commits

**Develop Branch PRs:**
- Minimum 1 approval required
- Self-approval allowed for minor fixes
- Code owner review for architectural changes

### Review Checklist

**Reviewers should verify:**
- [ ] All CI/CD checks pass
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Tests cover new functionality
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No secrets or sensitive data exposed
- [ ] Breaking changes are documented
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable

## üîÑ Merge Strategies

### Recommended Merge Types

**For `main` branch:**
- **Squash and merge** (preferred)
- Creates clean, linear history
- All commits in PR become single commit
- Commit message should be descriptive

**For `develop` branch:**
- **Create merge commit** (preferred)
- Maintains feature branch history
- Easier to track feature development
- Better for debugging and rollbacks

**Never use:**
- **Rebase and merge** (can cause confusion in team environment)

---

## üìä Branch Status Monitoring

### Recommended GitHub Apps

**Branch Protection Monitoring:**
- Enable branch protection rule notifications
- Set up alerts for rule violations
- Monitor bypass usage

**Code Quality Gates:**
- Codecov for coverage reports
- DeepCode or similar for security scanning
- Dependabot for dependency updates

### Metrics to Track

**Weekly Review:**
- Number of PRs merged
- Average time to merge
- CI/CD success rates
- Security scan results
- Code coverage trends

---

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Process

1. **Create hotfix branch** from `main`
2. **Implement minimal fix** (no feature additions)
3. **Fast-track review** (1 approval minimum)
4. **Merge to main** and tag release
5. **Cherry-pick to develop** or merge hotfix branch
6. **Deploy immediately** if critical
7. **Document incident** and follow-up actions

### Rollback Process

1. **Identify problematic commit/release**
2. **Create rollback branch** from last known good commit
3. **Update version numbers** if applicable
4. **Fast-track through CI/CD**
5. **Deploy to production**
6. **Investigate root cause**
7. **Plan proper fix** for next release

## üìù Configuration Validation

### Post-Setup Checklist

After configuring branch protection rules, validate with:

- [ ] Test PR creation and merge process
- [ ] Verify CI/CD integration works
- [ ] Confirm required reviewers are notified
- [ ] Test that force pushes are blocked
- [ ] Verify branch deletion is prevented
- [ ] Check that administrators are included in rules
- [ ] Test emergency bypass procedures

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- Status checks not appearing ‚Üí Ensure GitHub Actions have run at least once
- Rules not applying ‚Üí Check branch name patterns match exactly
- Bypass not working ‚Üí Verify administrator permissions
- CI/CD integration failing ‚Üí Check workflow names match exactly

---

## üîÑ Rule Maintenance

### Regular Review Schedule

**Monthly:**
- Review bypass usage logs
- Update required status checks if workflows change
- Assess if approval requirements are appropriate

**Quarterly:**
- Full review of all protection rules
- Update emergency procedures
- Review and update this documentation

**As Needed:**
- When adding new CI/CD workflows
- When team structure changes
- After security incidents
- When deployment processes change
